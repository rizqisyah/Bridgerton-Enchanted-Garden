"""Generate one placement table per band of Frame 244.

Same job the cover's `coverLayers.ts` does, done for all 14 bands at once.
Two things make this more than a coordinate dump:

1. Figma's reported bounds and the size it actually exports disagree in both
   directions -- see "exported bounds are not node bounds" in SLICING.md. Every
   layer is reconciled per axis against the real export, then template-matched
   against the 1x frame render, and the match wins wherever it fires.

2. Bands overlap. `section` in frame244-zorder.json is derived from heading
   positions, so hero's art runs to y 978 while quote starts at 709. A band's
   height is therefore the distance to the NEXT band's top, not the extent of
   its own children -- children that overrun simply paint past the boundary,
   which is what the design does anyway. `z` stays the global Figma child order
   so cross-band stacking survives the split.

    python3 scripts/gen_band.py            # every band
    python3 scripts/gen_band.py hero quote # just these

Writes src/lib/bands/<section>.ts and prints a per-band summary.

# and leaving the frame's left third bare. It is the left half of the pair: the render

# under 2706:157 and 2706:156, so locate.py only scores 60 there and the search never
# fires. Offline composite over rows 140-360, x 230-375: 6.358 at the reported 363,

# Same class of failure, but the y is wrong too, so PIN_X alone cannot fix it.
# 2712:169 is resepsi's third flower cluster. It reports 111,5258 -- the bare lattice
# in the middle of the arch, where the render shows nothing -- because it belongs in
# the LEFT DOME cluster, overlapping 2712:167/171. That overlap is also why locate.py
# scores it at err 76 where it belongs (its visible siblings score 59-152 at their own
# correct spots for the same reason), so the search never fires and the reported
# bounds stand. Settled by compositing the band offline and scoring rows 0-560 against

# 3.696 at 34,5143 -- which is exactly where locate.py put it too.
# 2706:157 is akad's other right-side rose cluster. It reports 262,4270 -- hanging low
# off the right pillar, below the arch spring -- but the render has it up in the dome
# cluster at 262,4155, which is also where locate.py puts it (err 77.69: the same
# occlusion trap, 2706:156's vine paints over it). Offline composite over rows 140-360,
